# Welcome to my repository for "The Farmer Was Replaced"!
## What is ["The Farmer Was Replaced"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced/)?

It is a programming game where you use a **subset** of Python to automate farming with a drone
### Limitations coding for "The Farmer Was Replaced":
#### Missing Python features in the game, and what I would've used them for:
- fStrings – Missing, which makes debugging and performance optimization harder.
- Classes – Could have helped manage grind orders, logs, and maze-solving.
- __Many__ built-in type methods, some notable mentions:
  - Almost everything string related.
  - `list.reverse`, `list.sort`, `list.index` and `list.count`

#### The game will refuse to execute any code that contains:
- Docstrings
- Type hinting
- Inlined statements (e.g., `else: return False`)

## Known issues and future plans

- Create the timed run scripts and auto unlocking.

## Attribution
- I'm a new coder that has taken code and indeed alot of this readme from other, more intelligent, people. Full credit to the developers and original authors of the code I use.
